## What is a multiplicative Fibonacci series?

The multiplicative Fibonacci Series (or simply mFibonacci Series), denoted by
$$
\mathbf{a_0, a_1, a_2, \dots , a_n}
$$

has the property that the product of every two consecutive members $\mathbf{a_{i-1}}$ and $\mathbf{a_i}$ gives the value of the next member $\mathbf{a_{i+1}}$. That is, $\mathbf{ a_{i+1} = a_{i-1}\cdot a_i }$.

Also, the initial values are specified as $\mathbf{a_0} = 2$ and $\mathbf{a_1} = 1$.

Here are the first ten members of the mFibonacci Series,

$$
\mathbf{ \ \ 2,\ \ 1,\ \ 2,\ \ 2,\ \ 4,\ \ 8,\ \ 32,\ \ 256,\ \ 8192,\ \ 2097152,\ \ \dots }
$$
